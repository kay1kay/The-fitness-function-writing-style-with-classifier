## Installation
Install Matlab 2021b or later versions and enable machine learning and deep learning features when installing the Matlab program.

## Usage
1. Open the application: `main.m` with Matlab (Matlab 2021b or higher is recommended due to the application of deep learning)
2. Run easily from the EDITOR tab

## Documentation
<sup>Many meta-heuristics and evolutionary algorithms use a classifier-based fitness function and also need to calculate a specific measurement. This code helps developers write a well-formed fitness function. You can contribute to this project. The revised version of the project will be placed with the name of the contributor in our GitHub repository.
The following describes how to construct a properly structured fitness function. To define a fitness function for deep learning classification in MATLAB, you can follow these steps:
**Data Preparation:** Start by preparing your dataset for training and evaluation. This typically involves loading your data, splitting it into training and validation sets, and preprocessing (e.g., normalization, feature scaling).
**Model Architecture:** Design your deep learning model architecture. MATLAB provides various ways to define models, such as using the Deep Learning Toolbox or creating custom architectures using the Neural Network Toolbox. Specify the number and type of layers, activation functions, and any other architectural choices.
**Training:** Train your deep learning model using your prepared dataset. This involves setting up the training parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) and utilizing an appropriate training algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Adam). MATLAB provides functions like “trainNetwork” and “fitcnet” for training deep learning models.
**Fitness Function Definition:** In the context of classification tasks, the fitness function measures the performance of your model based on certain evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Choose the evaluation metric(s) that align with your classification problem.
**Evaluation:** After defining the fitness function, evaluate your trained model on a separate validation or test set. Pass the predictions and true labels to your fitness function to compute the fitness score. MATLAB provides functions like classify or predict to obtain the predicted labels.
**Optimization:** To optimize your deep learning model, you can employ optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, or Bayesian optimization. These techniques iteratively modify the hyper parameters of your model (e.g., learning rate, number of layers) and evaluate the fitness function to find the optimal set of hyper parameters that maximize the performance metric.
Remember to iterate and refine your model architecture and hyper parameters based on the results obtained from evaluating the fitness function until you achieve satisfactory classification performance.
